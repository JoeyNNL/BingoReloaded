# All available placeholders are listed below under the placeholders section.
# The way you can use these placeholders is using the prefix bingoreloaded.
# For example %bingoreloaded_team_full% will be replaced by the bingo team name that player is in.
# These placeholders can also be used in the translation file if you wanted.
# When a placeholder is not available (e.g. current_tasks_team because no game is running), the placeholder will return '-' instead

# Formats support using minimessage.
